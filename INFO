Time Scale?
Go with monthly as in Yoot tower.
12 Months, 5 weekdays, 1 weekend in each.
Each spin of the loop is a 5 minute block == 288 frames a "day"
You can speed it up/slow it down as much as you want.
Default is 1 minute per day? So a frame is 5 seconds?
That maps us to 1RT second == 1GT minute.  Sounds slow, we'll have to test it.
-------- Tested it, that feels wrong. Too Slow.  I ended up liking it at ~30 Seconds RT per 1 day GT. This was 0.10 per frame.
