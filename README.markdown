# What is pyTower? #

pyTower is nothing yet.

# What will pyTower be? #

A sim tower descendent.

# Why? #

Clearly you never played sim tower.

Also, I need something to do.

# When? #

A long time.

# What about the other clones? #

What about them? They don't do much for me.

Also, they don't seem very complete.

Also, they weren't invented here ;-)

# What about the other pyTower stuff? #

So, I didn't search the name before using it, my bad.

I'd like to take this chance to say I am not affliated with the following:
